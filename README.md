This repository contains a Pokédex project developed as a practice to apply the knowledge acquired at the company Batatinha. The project is divided into two main parts:

## Frontend

The frontend was built using **React**, a popular JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. The Pokédex interface allows users to search and view detailed information about various Pokémon, including their types, abilities, stats, and more.

## Backend

The backend was developed with **NestJS**, a Node.js framework that helps build efficient and scalable server-side applications. The Pokédex backend is responsible for managing and providing data about the Pokémon, interacting with third-party APIs or internal databases to offer accurate and up-to-date information.

## Features

- **Pokémon Search:** Allows users to search for Pokémon by name.
- **Pokémon Details:** Displays detailed information about each Pokémon, such as types, abilities, and base stats.
- **Pokémon Listing:** Shows a paginated list of Pokémon, with the ability to filter by name and number.
- **Responsiveness:** Interface adapted for different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, CSS, HTML, JavaScript
- **Backend:** NestJS, TypeScript
- **Others:** Axios (for API calls), React Router (for navigation)
